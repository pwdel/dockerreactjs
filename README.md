# Docker + ReactJS

### Notes and Background About React and Node

* React - It's principlally a front end library.
* Node - Excellent choice for backend since it is asynchronous, has non-blocking I/O, and is event-driven nature. Also has front end capability.
* Together Using NPM, Node works alongside the NPM registry to easily install any package through the NPM CLI. Node bundles a React application into a single file for easy compilation using webpack and several other Node modules.

#### Side Note - the MERN Stack and How Things Could Differ

* MongoDB - document database
* Express(.js) - Node.js web framework
* React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework - frameworks provides you the skeleton of an application, including pre-built code to listen at a port, parse HTTP requests, and format HTTP responses.
* Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server - web server responds to HTTP requests, sending back the data the request asked for.

In the case of Flask, - Flask is the framework, whereas Werkzeug is the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI), whereas the server may be Ngnix. In python, they use WSGI as an attempt to standardize things, whereas Node has everything architected directly in Javascript, custom for Node and there is no WSGI standard. Another example of an alternate WSGI in python is Gunicorn.
